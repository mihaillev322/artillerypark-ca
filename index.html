<h2>What you'll see: heritage artillery displays and stories</h2>
<p>The heritage artillery displays at Artillery Park showcase authentic historical pieces alongside detailed interpretive panels that explain their period significance, tactical purposes, and technological evolution. Each artifact is presented within its proper historical context, allowing visitors to understand not just what they're seeing, but why these pieces mattered in their time and how they shaped military strategy and defense.</p>
<p>Interactive exhibits guide visitors through the development of artillery technology, from early cannon designs to more sophisticated pieces, with clear explanations of how these weapons influenced battles and military tactics throughout Canadian history. The interpretive approach emphasizes education over glorification, focusing on historical understanding and the human stories behind the technology.</p>
